**Design & Implementation Guide**

---

## Overview

TerraFlow is a planetary management game simulating the philosophical conflict between two cosmic forces: **The Gardeners** and **The Rulers**.  
Your goal: Guide a civilization through the “Great Transition,” balancing short-term control and long-term consciousness to achieve planetary harmony.

## Core Gameplay Loop

- **Manage resources:** Energy, Food, Population, Control, Consciousness
- **Build & upgrade structures** with distinct effects
- **Respond to events & crises**
- **Strategic choices:** Ruler (Control) vs. Gardener (Consciousness) development paths
- **Unlock special units & abilities** as the game progresses

---

## Tutorial & Early Game

- Begin as a **Planetary Administrator** focused on survival and growth
- Early choices introduce:
  - **Control:** Quick fixes, industrial solutions
  - **Consciousness:** Slow, holistic solutions
- Tutorial events present dilemmas:
  - Resolve unrest with **Security Station** (Control) or **Community Garden** (Consciousness)
- Immediate consequences are visible; long-term effects are discovered through play

## Tech Trees: The Two Paths

### Path of Industry (**Ruler**)
- **Focus:** Rapid advancement, centralized control, resource extraction
- **Buildings:** Industrial Mines, Automated Factories, Propaganda Towers, Centralized Power Grids
- **Effects:** Boost productivity, suppress unrest, increase pollution, slow consciousness growth
- **Visuals:** Angular, metallic, imposing

### Path of Harmony (**Gardener**)
- **Focus:** Resilience, well-being, sustainable growth
- **Buildings:** Permaculture Gardens, Wisdom Sanctuaries, Healing Groves, Mycelial Networks
- **Effects:** Boost consciousness, stabilize systems, reduce negative events, slower but more stable progress
- **Visuals:** Organic, flowing, integrated with nature

## Mid-Game Reveal: The Anomaly Quest

- Discover a mysterious artifact (Ancient Monolith, Crashed Bio-Ship)
- Research reveals the true history: two factions (Sages/Gardeners and Rulers)
- Tech trees are renamed to reflect this knowledge
- Previous choices gain new philosophical context

---

## End Game & Victory Conditions

- **Ruler Victory (“The Exodus”):**
  - Achieve final Ruler tech (**Exodus Ark**)
  - Escape the planet, join the galactic empire
  - Cinematic: Departure, polluted planet, bittersweet ending

- **Gardener Victory (“The Ascension”):**
  - Achieve maximum Consciousness
  - Heal the planet, awaken the population
  - Cinematic: Planetary transformation, true harmony

## Core Resources & Systems

- **Control:**  
  Generated by Ruler buildings; suppresses unrest, boosts efficiency, but reduces Consciousness and can trigger Tyranny events

- **Consciousness:**  
  Generated by Gardener buildings; boosts resilience, unlocks advanced tech, can resist Control and trigger Sovereignty events

- **Event System:**  
  Hidden entropy scores (Pollution, Unrest, Inequality) trigger “Deluge Waves” (systemic crises)

  - **Four Horsemen Events:**
    - *Famine:* Soil collapse from overuse
    - *Pestilence:* Pandemic in dense, low-wellbeing cities
    - *War:* Civil conflict from high unrest
    - *Death:* Climate catastrophe from pollution

  - **Social Game Events:**  
    Propaganda Campaigns, Consumer Trends, etc. — require strategic countermeasures

---

## Population Dynamics

- **NPCs:**  
  Default workers, efficient in Ruler buildings, prone to unrest

- **Awakened:**  
  Emerge with high Consciousness, immune to propaganda, required for Gardener buildings

- **Hybrids:**
  - *Sages:* Purify Ruler buildings, mitigate negative effects
  - *Heroes:* End crises by force, but reduce Consciousness

---

## Player Abilities (Manual Override)

- **Activate Observer:** Pause game, reveal hidden data (costs Consciousness)
- **Perseus Protocol:** Immunity to next negative event (costs Consciousness)
- **The Four Freedoms:** Apply a planetary effect (e.g., Ahimsa, Wu Wei) for a limited time (costs Consciousness)
- **Compass Teaching:** Re-orient a region, instantly reduce negative effects

---

## Integration & Synthesis

- Mixing Ruler and Gardener techs is possible but challenging
- Hybrid buildings and events force meaningful choices
- Late-game techs allow for synthesis (e.g., Geothermal Sanctuary)

---

## Conclusion

TerraFlow is designed as an experiential journey through your philosophical framework.  
Every mechanic, event, and narrative beat immerses the player in the tension between control and consciousness, making the game a living companion to your books.  
**Your choices shape not only your civilization, but your understanding of the deeper story beneath the surface.**
